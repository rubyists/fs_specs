== NOTES TO MYSELF ON WHAT I AM THINKING OF ==
----------------------------------------------

I want to create a EM factory.
In that EM factory, I want a timer that makes the EM factory live for 60 seconds
In that EM factory, I also want a timer that fires every 0.1 seconds.
I want that 0.1s timer to process any events and store them.
I want those events available outside the EM factory.
I want to process those events for known patterns.
